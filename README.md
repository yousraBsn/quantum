The figure below shows a comparison of accuracy between QSVM, QkNN, and QNN using two encoding strategies (Angle vs IQP). The results are reported across different numbers of PCA components.

QSVM (blue) achieves the highest accuracy and improves steadily with more PCA components.

QkNN (green) shows stable but slightly lower performance.

QNN (red) starts with lower accuracy but improves with increasing PCA components.
